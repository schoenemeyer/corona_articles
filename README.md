### New Clara Features to help COVID-19 Research
Clara Training Framework https://developer.nvidia.com/clara-medical-imaging  is the application level package of NVIDIA’s Clara Train SDK, a python-based SDK that allows developers looking into faster implementation of industry specific Deep Learning solutions to leverage optimized, ready-to-use, pretrained models built in-house by NVIDIA. These pre-trained models are packaged as Medical Model Archives (MMARs) to accelerate the developer’s deep learning training process and reduce higher costs associated with large scale data collection, labeling, and training models from scratch. 
A pre-trained model for volumetric (3D) segmentation of lung region from CT image is available here: https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:med:clara_train_covid19_ct_lung_seg

## Study from 2013 (written in German) "Bericht zur Risikoanalyse im Bevölkerungsschutz 2012"
The current situation was well described 8 years ago.

News collected from  "Deutsches Ärzteblatt" https://www.aerzteblatt.de/  Berlin. 
Editor: Bundesärztekammer.
## 1. Course of the disease

(1) March 16th: "a case report of non-severe COVID-19" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0819-2.pdf            
Summary: In many cases the immune system of patients seems to be well prepared for Corona Virus 

(2) March 9th: "Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study" https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S014067362305663.pdf                 
Summary: Cohort Study from Wuhan. 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.

(3) March 17th: NIH clinical trial of investigational vaccine for COVID-19 begins.   
https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins       
Summary: A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273.

(4) March 13: First Covid-19 case happened in November, China government records show - report   
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report

## 2. Spread and Transmission Paths

(1) March 17th: "Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1"        
https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?articleTools=true              
Summary: SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for a similar amount of time like under air and on surfaces like SARS-CoV-1 . Depending on the surfaces, half live can be up to 8 hours     

(2) March 17th: "A serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans"     https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1     
Summary: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies would help in reducing the growth rate of CV patients, because the current PCR only shows active infections. 

## 3. Treatment

Summary: Patients assigned to lopinavir–ritonavir did not show clinical improvement different from that of patients assigned to standard care alone in the intention-to-treat population

(2) February 4th: "Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0401839X         
Summary: Remdesivir and Chloroquine inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line 

(3) March: "COVID-19 Drug Therapy – Potential Options",  https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/988648/COVID-19-Drug-Therapy_Mar-2020.pdf     
Summary: in absence of an established treatment regimen,(CPAM) issued a novel 2019 coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) guideline in February 2020 with recommendations

## 4. Hospital Capacity Planning

(1) March 14: "Announcing CHIME, A tool for COVID-19 capacity planning"    
http://predictivehealthcare.pennmedicine.org/2020/03/14/accouncing-chime.html      
Summary: Informed estimates of how many patients will need hospitalization, ICU beds, and mechanical ventilation over the coming days and weeks will be crucial inputs to readiness responses and mitigation strategies.

## Simulators

(1) Gabriel Goh created an interactive epidemic calculator; it gives an excellent idea why transmission rate need to be reduced to a minimum 
Even under optimistic eestimations, we will have at least more than 50.000 infections beginning of April. The number of infected persons will stay above 30.000 through whole 2020.
