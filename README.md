## 1. Course of the disease

(1) March 16th: "a case report of non-severe COVID-19" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0819-2.pdf            
Summary: In many cases the immune system of patients seems to be well prepared for Corona Virus 

(2) March 9th: "Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study" https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S014067362305663.pdf                 
Summary: Cohort Study from Wuhan. 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.

(3) March 17th: NIH clinical trial of investigational vaccine for COVID-19 begins.   
https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins       
Summary: A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273.

## 2. Transmission Paths

(1) March 17th: "Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1"        
https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?articleTools=true              
Summary: SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for a similar amount of time like under air and on surfaces like SARS-CoV-1 . Depending on the surfaces, half live can be up to 8 hours     

## 3. Treatment

(1) March 18th: "A Trial of Lopinavir–Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19" https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282        
Summary: Patients assigned to lopinavir–ritonavir did not show clinical improvement different from that of patients assigned to standard care alone in the intention-to-treat population

(2) February 4th: "Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0401839X         
Summary: Remdesivir and Chloroquine inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line 

## 4. Origin of Corona Virus

(1) March 17th: "The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9.pdf      
Summary: Discussion on the origin of the causative virus, based on a comparative analysis of genomic data. Their analyses clearly shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus
