## 2. Transmission Paths

(1) March 17th: "Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1"       
Summary: SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for a similar amount of time like under air and on surfaces like SARS-CoV-1 . Depending on the surfaces, half live can be up to 8 hours https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?articleTools=true
